# Customer Support Automation with GPT-based Models

This project is a **Customer Support System** designed for a large electronics store. It leverages GPT-based models to generate customer comments and corresponding email responses. The app supports multi-language capabilities, allowing users to translate comments and emails into the top 30 most popular languages worldwide.

## Features

- **Automated Customer Comment Generation**: Simulate customer feedback by generating comments about products.
- **Email Response Generation**: Create professional email responses to customer comments.
- **Multi-language Support**: Translate comments and emails into 30 popular languages.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly web app with a responsive design.
- **Retained User Inputs**: Form inputs remain after submission for better user experience.
- **Customizable Design**: Aesthetic inspired by the Morandi color palette with options for further customization.

## Project Design

### Overview

The project is designed to automate customer support interactions by simulating both sides of the communicationâ€”the customer comment and the support email response. The core of the application revolves around leveraging GPT-based language models to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: A Flask web application serves as the user interface, allowing users to select options and view results.
- **Backend**: Python functions handle the logic for generating comments, analyzing sentiment, and creating email responses.
- **API Integration**: OpenAI's API is used to interact with the GPT-4 language model for text generation tasks.

### Flow of Data

1. **User Input**: The user selects a language and translation options on the web interface.
2. **Comment Generation**: The app generates a customer comment about a product using GPT.
3. **Email Generation**: An email response is generated based on the comment using the following steps:
   - generate email subject according to the comment
   - generate the summary of customer's comment
   - sentiment analysis of the customer's comment
   - generate an email to be sent to the customer
5. **Translation**: If selected, the comment and/or email are translated into the chosen language.
6. **Display Results**: The generated texts are displayed side by side on the web page.

### Error Handling

- **API Failures**: The app includes basic error handling to manage API exceptions, providing user-friendly messages.
- **Input Validation**: Form inputs are validated to prevent incorrect or malicious data from causing issues.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask**: Serves as the web framework for the application.
- **OpenAI API**: Utilized for generating text via the `gpt-4o-mini` model.
- **HTML/CSS**: Crafts the frontend interface with responsive design principles.
- **Python-dotenv**: Manages environment variables securely.
- **Bootstrap-inspired Styling**: Enhances UI elements for better aesthetics and responsiveness.
